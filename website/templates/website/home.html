            <h1>Greetings</h1>
            <p>My name is Nick. I'm a software engineer currently working at a small startup in Los Angeles, California. Most of my work revolves around Android, tinkering with the Camera2 API and FFmpeg.<br/><br/>
            I hope to use this website as a journal of tech musings and a portfolio of my creations. This will keep me accountable with my peers and push me to create side projects and blog content. Since working heavily with Android, I am eager to stretch myself in different environments. Web development remains a long-standing interest of mine, and I figured that starting my own website would be a good gateway. (If you're curious, this website is built with Django!) Here are a few other topics I look forward to exploring:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Web: Vue, React, Flask, Rails, Express</li>
                <li>Mobile: iOS, Flutter, React Native</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That's about all I have to say for this "hello world" post. Thanks for reading!</p>
